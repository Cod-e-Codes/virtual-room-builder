# 3D Room and Furniture Visualization

This project is a Python-based application that uses Matplotlib to create and visualize a 3D room and its furniture. The visualization includes elements such as chairs, tables, lamps, bookshelves, doors, and the room structure itself. This tool can be used to design and showcase basic 3D layouts of rooms.

## Features

- Render a customizable 3D room.
- Add furniture such as chairs, tables, lamps, and bookshelves.
- Plot doors in customizable locations.
- Interactive 3D visualization using Matplotlib.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`

To install the required libraries, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Ensure the required libraries are installed.
3. Run the `main.py` script to generate the 3D visualization:

```bash
python main.py
```
